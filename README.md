# Hybrid-Heuristic-ML-Ransomware-Detection

This repository contains the ipynb used to collect and compare the data of a heuristic-ml model hybrid against a pure ml model. Both are predicting for ransomware/goodware data samples from the dataset from https://github.com/muditmathur2020/RansomwareDetection/tree/master

The heuristic used checks whether the given data sample has an average entropy above a certain value.
